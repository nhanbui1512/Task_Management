# Task Management

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

> ✨ This project is created using **Create React App** and uses libraries such as **TailwindCSS** and **Ant Design** for styling and UI components.

## 📦 Installation

Before running the project, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you need full control over the configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject.
